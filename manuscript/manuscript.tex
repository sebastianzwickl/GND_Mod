\begin{abstract}
The primary goal of this paper is to investigate the most cost-effective decommissioning and refurbishment investment decision for existing gas networks. An optimization model is developed and tested on a real test bed in an Austrian federal state. The analysis is performed from the network operator's perspective and depicts different network decommissioning or refurbishment options under the decision of supplying or not supplying available gas demands. Whether or not there is ensured supply, we find that smaller gas networks (in terms of pipeline capacity and network length) are needed in the future. Analyzed shadow prices indicate that a balance/trade-off between the cost-optimal gas network design with and without ensured supply could lead to a robust and economically competitive future for downsized gas networks. The results demonstrate that it is necessary to socialize network operators' costs among the remaining consumers connected to the network in the future. This adds a cost component to consumers, which needs to be considered when determining the profitability of sustainable alternatives to natural gas.\\

\section{Current natural gas demands in Vorarlberg, Austria}\label{app_demand}
Figure \ref{fig:comp} shows current natural gas demands in Vorarlberg, Austria. The left subfigure shows natural gas demands in Vorarlberg, Austria, in 2018 and 2025. Open data and information from the internal database \cite{EEG} are used to split 2018's values into industry and (building) heating. The values are available at the provincial level (i.e., Vorarlberg, Austria). The 2025's values are calculated bottom-up. That means that we use data on natural gas demands at the community level (between 2018 and 2025). Note that the difference between 2018's and 2025's gas demands reflects the lack of gas demand data at the community level only. 

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{figures/Comparison_of_the_demand.eps}
	\caption{Overview of gas demands in 2018 and 2025 (left) and share of natural gas in total energy demand (right). Data: open data available; Avg.: shares calculated based on the average gas demand per capita in Vorarlberg, Austria; All: Data and Avg. combined.}
	\label{fig:comp}
\end{figure}

The right subfigure indicates the approach to calculating gas demands if no open data are available. It shows the share of natural gas demands in energy demand at the community level. The first item (Data) shows the distribution for those communities where data are available. The second item (Avg.) shows the distribution of gas demand shares using the average value of gas demand per capita in Vorarlberg, Austria. This calculation process based on the average gas demand is used for communities where no data are available. The third item (All) shows the distribution of gas demand shares for all communities.



\section{Assumptions regarding lumpiness of gas pipelines}\label{app:lum}
Similar to \cite{von2006reform}, we assume a simplified relationship between the diameter of gas pipelines and their capacities. Accordingly, we assume that the capacity of high- and mid-pressure gas pipelines increases by 2.5 times the power of the diameter. Table \ref{tab:lum} summarizes the set of potential diameters and the corresponding calculated capacity.
